# spotify-play
This is a simple web app that serves to manage playlists and queue tracks in a few ways that Spotify's current interface cannot. The intent of this project is mainly just to learn the basics of Node and to get a bit more comfortable developing web apps.

## Planned features
- Basic media controls
- Playlist merging
- Add/remove songs to Now Playing
- Add/remove entire or partial playlists to Now Playing
- Reorder queued tracks
- Retain position and track of previous queues
